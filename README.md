Project Overview
This project is a beginner-level data analysis that explores a public dataset of supermarket sales. The goal was to identify key sales trends, top-performing product lines, and general purchasing habits to understand market performance.

Dataset
The analysis was performed on a publicly available supermarket sales dataset, which included information such as date, product line, quantity, and sales figures.

Analysis & Key Findings
The analysis focused on several key areas, including monthly sales trends and performance by product category. A significant finding was the incomplete nature of the dataset, which only contained sales data for the first three months of the year.

Monthly Sales Trends: We discovered a clear trend for the first quarter, with sales peaking in January before a slight dip and recovery.

Top Product Categories: The top-performing product categories by sales were identified, showing which items were most popular with customers.

Data Scoping: A key takeaway was the importance of understanding the limitations of the data. The analysis concluded that any trend-based insights could only be applied to the first quarter of the year.

Tools Used
Data Analysis: [e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or Python (Pandas)]

Visualization: [e.g., Excel Charts, Matplotlib, or Power BI]
